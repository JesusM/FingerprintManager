KFingerprintManager
-------------------
A small library to handle Android fingerprint APIs.
 
 This library offers an easy way to handle authorisation and encryption tasks using Android
 Fingerprint APIs. It's based on Android fingerprint dialog sample made by Google: 
 https://github.com/googlesamples/android-FingerprintDialog.

## Use

 This library can be used to provide basic authentication through fingerprint API, using manual password as backup option. It also allows you to encrypt messages using fingerprint APIs.
 This library provides a sample to show how it can be used.

### Basic use:
 You import via gradle from <https://jitpack.io> adding this to your root build.gradle file:
 ```gradle
  allprojects {
    repositories {
      ...
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
  }
 ```
 and then adding the library as dependency:
 ```gradle
 dependencies {
   compile 'com.github.JesusM:FingerprintManager:{latest_version}'
 }
 ```
 (you can see which is the {latest_version} value from [releases tab](https://github.com/JesusM/FingerprintManager/releases))
 
 Create the fingerprint manager.
 ```java
 fingerPrintManager = KFingerprintManager(context, key);
 ```

 `key` is the name for the symmetric key that is created in the Android Key Store. KFingerprintManager.InitialisationCallback contains a set of method that are called whether the fingerprint is ready to be used or when there is any error (like no fingerprint has been enrolled yet, or if there has been a problem initialising it).

 Once the library is ready to be used, it provides two features: authentication and encryption.

#### Authentication
 Authentication provides the simplest way to authenticate a user. Once it uses its fingerprint scanner, you'll obtain enough information to allow any operation that requires a user authentication.
 The library API is pretty simple, just call `startAuthentication` method passing to it a callback that will let you know the result of the operation. If the authentication went ok, you'll obtain a `CryptoObject` object that will let you use for authentication operations (see [encryption](#encryption) to see what you can do with that data)

 Logic to authenticate using fingerprint: 

  ```kotlin
    fingerPrintManager.authenticate(object : KFingerprintManager.AuthenticationCallback {
        override fun onAuthenticationFailedWithHelp(help: String?) {
            // Logic when decryption failed with a message
        }

        override fun onAuthenticationSuccess() {
            // Logic when authentication has been successful
        }

        override fun onSuccessWithManualPassword(password: String) {
            // Logic when authentication has been successful writting password manually
        }

        override fun onFingerprintNotRecognized() {
            // Logic when fingerprint was not recognized
        }

        override fun onFingerprintNotAvailable() {
            // Logic when fingerprint is not available
        }

        override fun onCancelled() {
            // Logic when operation is cancelled by user
        }
    }, getSupportFragmentManager());
  ```

#### Encryption/Decryption

  Encryption/decryption operations will be only done using fingerprint APIs, so if fingerprint is not present or suitable, it will fail.

  Logic to encrypt an String message using the library:
  ```kotlin
    fingerPrintManager.encrypt(messageToBeEncrypted, object : KFingerprintManager.EncryptionCallback {
        override fun onFingerprintNotRecognized() {
            // Logic when fingerprint was not recognized
        }

        override fun onAuthenticationFailedWithHelp(help: String?) {
            // Logic when decryption failed with a message
        }

        override fun onFingerprintNotAvailable() {
            // Logic when fingerprint is not available
        }

        override fun onEncryptionSuccess(messageEncrypted: String) {
            // Logic to handle the encrypted message
        }

        override fun onEncryptionFailed() {
            // Logic to handle decryption failure
        }

        override fun onCancelled() {
            // Logic when operation is cancelled by user
        }
     }, getSupportFragmentManager());
  ```

  Logic to decrypt an already encrypted message:

  

  ```kotlin
    fingerPrintManager.decrypt(messageToDecrypt, object : KFingerprintManager.DecryptionCallback {
        override fun onDecryptionSuccess(messageDecrypted: String) {
            // Logic that handles successful decryption result
        }

        override fun onDecryptionFailed() {
            // Logic to handle decryption failure
        }

        override fun onFingerprintNotRecognized() {
            // Logic when fingerprint was not recognized
        }

        override fun onAuthenticationFailedWithHelp(help: String?) {
            // Logic when decryption failed with a message
        }

        override fun onFingerprintNotAvailable() {
            // Logic when fingerprint is not available
        }

        override fun onCancelled() {
            // Logic when operation is cancelled by user
        }
     }, getSupportFragmentManager());
  ```

### Customisation:

The library allows you to customise how the visual component is displayed. In order to do that, you can follow these steps:

 1.- Declare a xml them like this:

  ```xml
    <style name ="DialogThemeLight" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.Dialog.MinWidth">
        <item name="colorAccent">@color/dialog_light_theme_accent</item>
        <item name="android:colorAccent">@color/dialog_light_theme_accent</item>
        <item name="android:background">@color/dialog_light_theme_background</item>
        <item name="android:textColorPrimary">@color/dialog_light_theme_text_color_primary</item>
        <item name="android:textColorSecondary">@color/dialog_light_theme_text_color_secondary</item>
    </style>
  ```

  2.- Once you have the theme, the library provides a method to set it:
   ```kotlin
   fingerPrintManager.setAuthenticationStyle(theme);
   ```

In the [screenshots](#screenshots) section you can see some samples of the customisations.
